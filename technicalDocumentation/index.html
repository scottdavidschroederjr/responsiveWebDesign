  <p>Cards are the basic pieces that make up the game of Hearthstone. Each card represents an action that the player can take by playing that card. There are four main types of cards: minion cards, spell cards, weapon cards, and hero cards.<p>
  <p>Cards are either collectible or uncollectible. Collectible cards come from a variety of card sets, including expansions, adventures, the two core sets of Basic and Classic, and the Hall of Fame set. Uncollectible cards can come from card sets as well, but most come from game modes such as Solo Adventures and Tavern Brawls. Only collectible cards can normally be used by players to create decks to play in the Casual and Ranked regular play modes.</p>
  <p>As of Ashes of Outland, Hearthstone features more than 4,465 fully playable cards, of which exactly 2,496 cards can be collected by players. For the precise number of collectible cards found in each card set, see Card set table.</p>
  <p>All of these cards are also broken down into five different rarities:
    <li>Free
    <li>Common
    <li>Rare
    <li>Epic
    <li>Legendary  
  </p>

  <header>Minion</header>
  <p>Minions are persistent creatures on the battlefield that will fight for their hero. Minion cards can be recognized by their Attack (a number displayed on a yellow sword, in the bottom left corner) and Health (a number displayed on a red blood drop, in the bottom right corner).</p>
  <p>Minions are controlled by the player who summoned them, and can be commanded to attack their opponent's minions, or even the opposing hero. Minions with Taunt can act as defenders, preventing the opponent's forces from attacking the hero directly with melee attacks until that minion is destroyed. Minions are a major element in battles between heroes, and are usually responsible for the majority of all damage dealt in a game.</p>

<section class=main-section id=weapon>
  <header>Weapon</header>
  <p>Weapons are special cards which can be equipped by heroes. Each weapon has an Attack value and a Durability value. Each hero can only equip one weapon at a time, and equipping a new weapon will destroy the old one. Equipped weapons are displayed to the left of the hero's portrait.<p>
  <p>While a weapon is equipped, the hero's Attack will be increased by an amount equal to the weapon's Attack during their turn, and attacking while a weapon is equipped will reduce its Durability by 1. When a weapon's Durability is reduced to zero, the weapon is destroyed. Weapons are the main way of allowing heroes to attack other characters.</p>

<section class=main-section id=spell>
  <header>Spell</header>
  <p>Spell cards are cards that can be played to trigger a one time effect or ability, described in the card's text. Casting a spell consumes the card, producing an immediate effect, although spells with the Secret or Quest ability are delayed until activated by specific events. Spell cards do not have Attack or Health attributes, only a mana cost, shown in the top left corner.<p>
  <p>Added in Forged in the Barrens, some spells belong to specific schools. Acting as a parallel to Minion types, spell schools allow certain cards to interact with spells that belong to the stated school. Each of the schools are based on the basic Magic schools in World of Warcraft, with the exception of Fel. Spell schools are relatively restricted to caster classes like Mage and Priest, as there is no Physical school to encompass many Warrior and Rogue spells.</p>
  <pr>
  <code>Arcane - Found primarily on Mage and Druid spells</code><br>
  <code>Fel - Found primarily on Warlock and Demon Hunter spells</code><br>
  <code>Fire - Found primarily on Mage and Warlock spells</code><br>
  <code>Frost - Found primarily on Mage and Shaman spells</code><br>
  <code>Holy - Found primarily on Paladin and Priest spells</code><br>
  <code>Nature - Found primarily on Shaman and Druid spells</code><br>
  <code>Shadow - Found primarily on Priest and Warlock spells</code><br><br>
  <code>General - Spells without a school do not benefit from any school synergies</code><br>

  <header>Hero</header>
  <p>Hero cards are a type of card first introduced in the Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion. Upon being played, a hero card will replace the player's hero, give them a small amount of Armor and replace their Hero Power with a new one.</p>
